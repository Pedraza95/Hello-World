Learning the ropes to coding
My name is Eduardo Pedraza. Im 24, born on July 4th. Ive been into coding and software development since i was a child. Im highly intrigued by how these apps and social platforms are created. websites etc. Here I am trying to learn a thing or two to get me ahead of where i am now.
